# urlShortener
A URL shortener API built with Java and Spring Boot.
A URL shortener is a service that is used to create short links from very long URLs.
Short links have the size of one third or even one-fourth of the original URL, which makes them easier to type, present, or tweet. 
Clicking on a short link user will be automatically redirected to the original URL.
There are many URL shortening services available online, like tiny.cc, bitly.com, cutt.ly, etc.

**Functional requirements:**

1. Users need to be able to enter a long URL. Our service should save that URL and generate a short link.
2. Clicking on the short link should redirect the user to the original long URL.
