# urlShortener
A URL shortener API built with Java and Spring Boot.

A URL shortener is a service that is used to create short links from very long URLs by applying a hashing algorithm.

The first URL Shortener was created by a web developer named Kevin Gilbertson, the founder of TinyURL in 2002. 

Annoyed at sending long links on forums, Kevin decided to do something to improve his user experience.

Short links have the size of one third or even one-fourth of the original URL, which makes them easier to type, present, or tweet. 

Clicking on a short link will have a user be automatically redirected to the original URL.

There are many URL shortening services available online, like tiny.cc, bitly.com, cutt.ly, etc.

**Functional requirements:**

1. Users need to be able to enter a long URL. Our service should save that URL and generate a short link.

2. Clicking on the short link should redirect the user to the original long URL.

**Tools Used:**

Languages: Java
